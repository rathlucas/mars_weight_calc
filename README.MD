# MARS WEIGHT CALCULATOR

## Description

This is a introductory project used on the course "Learn Rust by Writing Real Applications", which I was able to write an weight converter based on how one's weight is measured on Mars.

## Applied Concepts

In this application I was able to understand more about:

- Mutability
- Ownership and Borrowing
- Memory pointers
- Pattern matching for error handling
- Loops
- The Rust stdlib and std::io module

## How to Run this Application

First of all, you need to make sure to have Rust and Cargo installed on your operating system. More details about that can be found on the Rust docs.
After this, all you need to do is run in your terminal of choice `cargo run`
